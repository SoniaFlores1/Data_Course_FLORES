2. For my final project, I want to use R for multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
creation to learn about how to perform alignments using the msa R package and verify its ability
to use ClustalW, ClustalOmega, and MUSCLE. I want to test this by aligning and creating a tree
using a Mitochondrial gene (I haven't decided which one yet) from various birds, with maybe
a crocodilian or other reptile as an outgroup. 

3. The data I'm going to be using will be FASTA files describing the DNA sequences of the target
genes from various species of animals. I will be getting that data from NCBI's GenBank. 
I can also use the amino acid sequences for the proteins from some genes as well, if possible.
For example, the FASTA would have text such as the following:

>NC_034838.1:878-2958 Corvus corax isolate 70173 mitochondrion, complete genome
GCAGTAAAGTGGGACAATCGAGCCCTCTTTAAGCCGGCTCTGGGACACGTACATACCGCCCGTCACCCTC
CTCACAAGCGACCCCCAACCCCATTACATTAATACGCTATCTAGCTAAAGAGGAGGCAAGTCGTAACAAG....

This along with other FASTA files from different species will be aligned in R and then used to
form a phylogenetic tree in R using the Ape package. 

4. Look at the file called "final_project_example_data.txt" to see how the data would look like.

5. I am unsure on how a plot would look like with this type of data.
